# evil_maze_game
this is a minigame I made years ago for a silly project I worked with a friend, it was rushed and the code is a bit spaghetti, the game works in this way:

you can use WASD to move your character and E to interact with levers, your goal is to exit the maze, but remember, if you look straight at a mirror you explode and die (it made sense in context when this project was made originally), mirrors have different colors which indicate which pressure plates and levers can interact with them.
Press L to save and press it again to load the save, this feature has been added in like 2 minutes right now so it isn't that polished (basically there's no UI or animation showing that the action has succeded).

This project contains the track Stage 2 by sawsquarenoise, you can find the link here https://freemusicarchive.org/music/sawsquarenoise/dojokratos/stage-2
